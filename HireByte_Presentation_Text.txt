# HIREBYTE AI - PRESENTATION CONTENT

=========================================
SLIDE 1: TITLE SLIDE
=========================================
Project Name: HireByte AI
Tagline: The Intelligent Interview Twin
Subtitle: Personalized Mock Interviews with Real-Time Vision Analytics

=========================================
SLIDE 2: PROPOSED SOLUTION
=========================================
* Problem: Interview preparation is often generic, expensive, or lacks real-time feedback on body language.
* Solution: HireByte AI provides an end-to-end simulated environment that mimics real professional interviews.
* How it works: It dynamically reads YOUR resume and the specific Job Description to generate relevant, high-quality questions.
* The Edge: Provides live 'Vision Analytics' to track your focus, confidence, and stress levels while you speak.

=========================================
SLIDE 3: TECHNICAL APPROACH - TECH STACK
=========================================
* Frontend: React 18 with TypeScript for a high-performance, interactive dashboard.
* Backend: Python (FastAPI) for high-speed data processing and WebSocket management.
* AI Brain: GPT-4o for intelligent conversation and personalized feedback generation.
* Speech: Whisper (Speech-to-Text) and OpenAI TTS (AI Speaking).
* Vision: OpenCV (Haar Cascades) for real-time facial tracking and eye-contact measurement.

=========================================
SLIDE 4: TECHNICAL APPROACH - IMPLEMENTATION
=========================================
* Context Mapping: Seamlessly combines Resume details with Job requirements for realistic questions.
* Dual-Stream System: Processes Voice (audio) and Video (frames) simultaneously via low-latency WebSockets.
* 10 FPS Vision Loop: Captures frames at high frequency for lag-free posture and focus analysis.
* Dynamic Dashboard: Automatically generates charts and AI-driven feedback summaries immediately after the interview.

=========================================
SLIDE 5: FEASIBILITY AND VIABILITY
=========================================
* Feasibility: Built using browser-native APIs; runs on standard laptops without requiring expensive external hardware.
* Potential Risks: Background lighting or network latency can affect real-time metrics.
* Mitigations: Implemented "Adaptive Smoothing" (Hysteresis) algorithms to filter sensor noise and ensure stable, accurate data analysis in varied lighting conditions.

=========================================
SLIDE 6: IMPACT AND BENEFITS
=========================================
* Individual Impact: Helps students and job seekers overcome interview anxiety in a safe, private, and low-risk environment.
* Economic Benefit: Reduces job search duration by improving performance in crucial first-round screening interviews.
* Social Benefit: Levels the playing field for introverts or non-native speakers by providing honest, unbiased, AI-driven coaching.
* Scalability: High potential for integration into college placement cells and corporate recruitment workflows.
